First, the screen will display a list of sliders that allow the user to change the value of the factors to the left such as birth rate and economy
The user chooses from a dropdown that gives an option to choose from 5 countries
Theh user can click a button to run a simulation based on the initial values of the factors for 20 years
The user can also click a button to run a live simulation and stop whenever the user feels like it and change the factors as the population changes. 
To the right is a pie chart showing which factors are impacting the population the most.
In the center is a population vs time graph.
In the top there is also a number showing the exact population at the given time.
There is also a map of the country which will have dots that increase or decrease in size as the population changes. 
The goal is for the user to find out how different factors work together to change the population. For instance, if birth rate is too high but food supply is too low then this would cause the death rate to increase since people aren't receiving enough nutrition.
